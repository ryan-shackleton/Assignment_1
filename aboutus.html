    <h1>Company Background</h1>
    <p>
        This website was developed by Ryan Shackleton.<br />
        I am a student at the University of South Florida (USF), enrolled in the Master of Science in AI and Business Analytics (AIBA) program.
        I also earned an MBA in IT Management from USF in 2024 and am currently employed as a Data Operations Analyst II at a fintech firm.
        To construct this website, I used various technologies. For example, all the photos on the website were generated using Microsoft Copilot, primarily for copyright purposes.
        I also watched various videos on YouTube and used Google Search to assist me whenever I encountered challenges or wanted to learn something new. W3Schools was also a highly useful resource.
        For the development of this website, I utilized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
